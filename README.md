# FinaPoints
This program is for all those people interested in the way of swimming. The program is used to calculate FINA scores from race times. The program is written in go language..
The program takes as input two .csv files (originally edited on a spreadsheet), respectively containing the table with the base times and the table containing the athletes and their races with their respective times. The program processes the first file by creating a map containing all the data in the file, so that it can be easily used later. The map has the stroke as its key and a struct containing the men's and women's time in seconds as its value. The second file is used as the starting structure for creating the output (which, if saved as a .csv file, allows you to obtain a spreadsheet with all the new information). So the program loops through all the information in the second file, adding the corresponding FINA score following the times of the respective races.
The second file must have a very specific structure: the first column must contain the athletes' first and last names, the second must contain the athletes' gender, indicated by "m" and "f"; from the third onwards, the race (stroke) and the corresponding time alternate respectively; there is no minimum or maximum limit on the number of races the file must contain. (there shouldn't be too many columns anyway, otherwise it would cause panic error.)
